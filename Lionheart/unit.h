/* the basics for the implementation of this class *

r should never be less than 0 or greater than ROWS-1.

c should never be less than 0 or greater than COLS-1.

hp should never be less tan 0.

dir should always be up, dn, lt, or rt.

rank should always be crown, knoght, archer, or infantry.

dead is true if and only if hp is 0.

The tla can be any three character string.;

void Move(int dist): Move the unit dist steps in the current dir.
No error checking is needed, because the game won't let you move
through another unit, on top of another unit, or off the board.

int Attack(): Return the number of hits generated by the unit
in an attack. Roll one six-sided die per hp.  For archers, any
time you roll a 1 or a 2, generate one hit.  For all other units,
any time you roll a 2, 3, or 4, generate one hit.  Return the
total number of hits.

void Suffer(int hits): For infantry and archers, reduce the number
of hp by hits.  For knights and crowns, reduce hp by hits/2.  if
hp becomes 0 or less, set it back to zero and set dead to true.

void Place(int minR,int maxR,int minC,int maxC, SitRep sitrep): set
r to a value greater than or equal to minR and less than or equal
to maxR. set c to a value greater than or equal to minC and less
than or equal to maxC.  [r,c] must be unique for all units that
share the same tla (i.e., each unit must have its own space). Use
the information in the sitrep to help you decide what to do here.

Action Recommendation(SitRep sitrep): return an Action to the game
that is your units recommendation for what it should do next.  This
function should not change any of the private data elements of the
object.  Use the information in the sitrep to help you decide what
to do here.figure this out.

SitRep:  This is a struct that contains a 2D map of Things.  Each
Thing is a struct that provides information about what is in the
space.  It has a What, which is either a space, a rock, or a unit.
If the What is a unit, the other parts of the Thing (rank, hp, dir,
and tla) are set to the correct information for that unit.

Action:  This stuct is returned by the Recommendation function and
describes what the unit "wants" to do.  It contains an ActionType
(turn, fwd, attack, or nothing).  If the action is to move, then
maxDist indicates how far the unit wants to move, subject of course
to the movement rules in the game.  If the action is to turn, then
dir is set to the desired direction.  If the action is to attack and
the unit is an archer, then ar and ac are set to the location the
archer wishes to attack, subject to the rules of the game.
